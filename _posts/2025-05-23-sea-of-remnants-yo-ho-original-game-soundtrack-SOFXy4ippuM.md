Lyric:

I left a nice piece of rock for the open Sea,
Whatever life I had will soon be a memory,
Freedom never tasted so sweet,
To a jolly pirate with a head full of dreams,
Yo Ho it's the pirate life for me,
Yo Ho look at all me eccentricity,
Yo Ho! Yo Ho a chest full of gold,
And every time the wind blows I feel it in my soul,
Ay Ay I'm goin' for an adventure of a lifetime,
Ay Ay I do it all for the treasure of bein' alive,
Rrrrrr me matey! Yo Ho baby!
Throw up the sails and we ride,
We rrrrrrr we rrrrrrr we are not here to compromise,
Your wars are small next to the ocean,
Out here everybody's in the motion,
Can you feel it like a rebel from the deep,
Like a jolly pirate sailing out into the open Sea,
Yo Ho it's the pirate life for me,
Yo Ho look at all me eccentricity,
Yo Ho Yo Ho a chest full of gold.
And every time the wind blows, I feel it in my soul,
Ay Ay I'm goin' for an adventure of a lifetime,
Ay Ay I do it all for the treasure of bein' alive,
Rrrrrr me matey! Yo Ho baby!
Throw up the sails and we ride,
We rrrrrrr we rrrrrrr we are not here to compromise,
Ay Ay I'm goin' for an adventure of a lifetime,
Ay Ay I do it all for the treasure of bein' alive,
Rrrrrr me matey! Yo Ho baby!
Throw up the sails and we ride,
We rrrrrrr we rrrrrrr we are not here to compromisse.
