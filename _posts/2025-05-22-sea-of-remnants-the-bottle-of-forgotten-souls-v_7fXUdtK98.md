About Sea of ​​Remnants: 

Sea of Remnants is an original ocean adventure RPG developed by Joker Studio. Your journey begins as a puppetfolk sailor who has lost their memory. Alongside a mysterious girl, you’ll set sail on a chaotic and colorful voyage—one filled with treasure, conflict, dreams, and unexpected companions. As the seas stretch endlessly before you, an epic world of myth and history slowly unfolds. But beware, Captain: fall overboard, and your mind may be swallowed by the very thing this ocean was named for—forgetting.
