Planet Party Time is a social simulation game that's all about growth, and perfect for any kind of player. It combines the therapeutic elements of social simulation games with the creative fun of party games so that all players can find their niche.

You also have another identityâ€” one of the carefully selected Cube Galaxy Union Hero Candidates. Find like-minded teammates and join together to explore the mysteries of outer space. During your free time, you can sign up for various scheduled minigames, winning extra rewards while meeting new friends (or perhaps rivals).

The game also offers a simple yet powerful level editor, allowing you to create brand-new minigames and invite your friends to join a party of your creation!
