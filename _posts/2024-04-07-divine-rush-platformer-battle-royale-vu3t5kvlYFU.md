Gameloft has announced its newest game, Divine Rush. 

The new title will be a platformer royale style racing game, something like Fall Guys, but instead of characters running and stumbling, the heroes of Divine Rush will run, jump, glide and fly and use unique abilities throughout the scenario. 

The game is only scheduled to arrive on PC, for now.</p>
