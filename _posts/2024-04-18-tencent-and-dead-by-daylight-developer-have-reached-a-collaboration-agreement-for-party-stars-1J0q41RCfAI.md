<p class="youtube-post-description">Tencent and Behaviour have reached a collaboration agreement for Party Stars Big Bad Hunt asymmetrical mode. Mathieu Cote, Dead By Daylight lead producer, will guide the gameplay design, with the aim of continually optimizing the asymmetrical competitive experience.

Big Bad Hunt has been extremely popular on Party Stars, and is Tencent's first entry into the asymmetrical competitive genre, which has been reigned alone in China by NetEase with games like Identity V, Tom and Jerry: Chase, Dead By Daylight Mobile and Mission Zero.

For those who are confused about why this is being referred to as a game mode and not a game, Party Stars is a UGC game platform like Roblox, so there are several modes that are complete games within a single game.
