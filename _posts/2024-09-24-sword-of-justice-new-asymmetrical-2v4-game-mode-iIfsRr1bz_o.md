<p class="youtube-post-description">Sword of Justice - New Asymmetrical 2v4 Game Mode

As Identity V continues to become a hit again in China, NetEase is constantly exploring how to add new asymmetrical experiences to its existing titles. We've already seen the addition of the asymmetrical "Fright Night Escape" mode in Eggy Party, and now NetEase's martial arts MMORPG Sword of Justice is also getting its own 2v4 asymmetrical experience. 

About Sword of Justice:

Sword of Justice is an Open world game, famous for its exquisite and delicate picture quality, real and vivid Jianghu atmosphere, subversion of traditional MMO techniques, and intelligent Al's profound impact on the game world. It is known as the "breathing Jianghu".
