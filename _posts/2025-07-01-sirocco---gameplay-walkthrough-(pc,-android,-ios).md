<p class="youtube-post-description">Sirocco - Gameplay Walkthrough (PC, Android, iOS)

MOBA meets Vampire Survivors in a dynamic 5v5 arena inspired by the legendary Warcraft 3 mod: Battleships. Rally your team as you swap abilities mid-match, load up auto-firing weapons, and craft strategies on the fly. No rules, just fun. Without fixed roles and hard counters, learn as you go and discover your own strategies instead of being punished for not following the strategies of others. Sirocco utilizes an auto-fire mechanic and economic system that promotes team fighting and positioning over last hitting NPCs.
