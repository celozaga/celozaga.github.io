Venture into the storm-swept Crosslands that lie between the human world and the spirit realm to discover a kind and creative community where you are always welcome. In this epic multiplayer simulation game from the creators of "Cozy Grove," you can find friendship and new possibilities each day in a vast, beautiful shared world.

TURN STRANGERS INTO FRIENDS
Forge new connections with fellow players (not to mention wild spirits, human villagers and lovably silly bears) in the bustling village of Spirit Crossing and beyond. Chat, craft, build, dance and celebrate together — and invite your real-world loved ones to join the party.

BUILD YOUR WAYSTATION
Work together with other players to shape the settlement you share. Harvest resources, craft supplies, and collectively decide what to build — from lush orchards to sky-high towers — as you create the town of your dreams. You can also furnish and decorate your own cozy room however you please.

KEEP YOUR NEIGHBORS SAFE
Storms rage through the Crosslands, tearing down buildings and drawing in lonely spirits. Perform acts of kindness for others and leave offerings to restore the great Beacons that protect each Waystation and hold the storms at bay.

EXPLORE THE WILDERNESS
This ever-shifting landscape changes every few days, offering new quests and opportunities. Venture out alone or with friends as you collect resources and search for spirits and villagers to connect with. Work together to build shortcuts that speed up travel.

A PLACE YOU CAN ALWAYS GO
Each day here brings new surprises, activities and events. Between crafting projects, hunting for collectibles, experimenting with fashion and helping out friends, there's no such thing as a dull or lonely moment in the Crosslands.
